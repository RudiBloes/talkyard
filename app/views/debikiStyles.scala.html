@* COULD_OPTIMIZE fontello-embedded is a render blocking resource â€” instead, just link to the woff/2 instead, and preload. *@

@* For now, use Open-Sans always, because Ty's paddings and margins look nice with
this font size. (Other fonts can have slightly larger or smaller letters.)
Google's Roboto maybe looks nice too?  Previously used Bree Serif.

Preload regular, italic and bold. But maybe skip, if a non-latin language?
However currently somewhat many texts haven't been translated yet, so need
en_US letters anyway.
Sync with font weights [sync_fonts] so we're preloading the correct files.
